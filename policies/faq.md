Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
1. Can I return an electronics product if I opened the packaging?

It depends on the product condition, region, and reason for return. Opened electronics may be subject to restocking fees or may be ineligible for return if used beyond basic inspection. For details, see the Returns, Exchanges & Restocking Fees Policy.

2. What is considered a DOA (Dead on Arrival) product?

A product is considered DOA if it is non-functional upon first delivery and initial use. DOA issues must be reported within 48 hours of delivery and may require photographic or video evidence. See the Warranty & Repairs (RMA) Policy for eligibility and remedies.

3. Who pays for return shipping if my product is defective?

For approved warranty or DOA claims, the Store may cover return shipping costs depending on the region and carrier. For rejected claims or non-defective returns, the Customer is responsible for shipping costs. See the Warranty & Repairs (RMA) Policy and Returns Policy for details.

4. Do you ship electronics with lithium batteries internationally?

Some battery-powered products are subject to shipping restrictions depending on destination and carrier regulations. Certain regions may not be eligible for air shipping. See the Shipping, Customs & Restricted Items Policy for region-specific limitations.

5. What happens if customs refuses my shipment?

If a shipment is refused due to unpaid duties or regulatory restrictions, it may be returned or abandoned. Any associated costs may be deducted from a refund, and refunds are not guaranteed. Refer to the Shipping, Customs & Restricted Items Policy.

6. Can I return a clearance item?

Clearance items are generally non-returnable unless defective or required by law. Warranty rights may still apply. See the Returns, Exchanges & Restocking Fees Policy and Warranty Policy for applicable exceptions.

Replacement products may be new or refurbished and functionally equivalent. Refurbished replacements carry the remainder of the original warranty period. See the Warranty & Repairs (RMA) Policy.

Damage must be reported within 48 hours of delivery and include photographic evidence of the packaging and product. Claims submitted outside this timeframe may be denied. See the Shipping, Customs & Restricted Items Policy.
