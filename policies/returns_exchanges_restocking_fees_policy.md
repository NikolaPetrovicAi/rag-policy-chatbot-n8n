returns must be requested within 30 calendar days from the delivery date.

3.2 EU Cooling-Off Period

For Customers located in the European Union:

a 14-day cooling-off period applies to eligible products,

Non-returnable status does not affect warranty rights where applicable.

6. Restocking Fees

the product has been opened or unsealed,

packaging is damaged or incomplete,

accessories are missing.

Restocking fees:

may range from 10% to 25% of the product price,

are deducted from the refund amount,

are disclosed during the return approval process.

7. Return Shipping Costs

Unless the return is due to:

a manufacturing defect,

a DOA (Dead on Arrival) product,

8. Exchanges

Exchanges are permitted only under the following circumstances:

the product is defective,

the product is DOA,

the Store explicitly approves an exchange request.

Exchanges are subject to product availability. If an exchange is not possible, the Store may issue a refund instead.

9. Refund Processing

Once a returned product is received and inspected:

the Store will notify the Customer of approval or rejection,

approved refunds are processed to the original payment method,

processing time may vary depending on the payment provider.

Refunds may be adjusted to account for restocking fees or missing components.

If a refund has not been received within the expected timeframe, the Customer should:

contact their payment provider,

11. Relationship to Warranty and Shipping Policies
