Support SLA & Dispute Resolution Policy
1. Purpose and Scope

This policy defines customer support response times, escalation procedures, and dispute resolution mechanisms. It applies to all customer inquiries, claims, and disputes related to orders, products, warranties, shipping, and refunds.

This policy should be read together with the Store Policy Overview and other applicable store policies.

2. Customer Support Channels

The Store provides customer support through designated channels, which may include:

email support,

web-based contact forms,

account-based support tickets.

Support is provided in the English language unless otherwise stated.

3. Support Response Times (SLA)

The Store aims to meet the following response time targets:

Initial response: within 24–48 Business Hours

Follow-up responses: within 48–72 Business Hours, depending on case complexity

Response times may be extended during peak periods, holidays, or due to factors beyond the Store’s control.

4. Required Information for Support Requests

To ensure efficient handling, Customers may be required to provide:

order number,

product serial number,

detailed description of the issue,

photographic or video evidence where applicable.

Failure to provide required information may delay or prevent resolution.

5. Escalation Process

If an issue cannot be resolved at the initial support level, it may be escalated internally.

Escalation may occur in cases involving:

unresolved warranty claims,

disputed return eligibility,

repeated shipping issues,

alleged policy violations.

Escalated cases are reviewed by senior support or compliance personnel.

6. Dispute Resolution

Customers are encouraged to contact support before initiating formal disputes, chargebacks, or legal action.

The Store will make reasonable efforts to resolve disputes through:

clarification of applicable policies,

review of submitted evidence,

alternative remedies where appropriate.

7. Chargebacks and Payment Disputes

If a Customer initiates a chargeback or payment dispute:

the Store may temporarily suspend order processing or account access,

supporting documentation may be submitted to the payment provider,

ongoing support requests related to the disputed order may be paused.

Chargebacks may negatively affect future purchase eligibility.

8. Evidence and Investigation

For disputes involving defects, delivery issues, or misuse, the Store may:

request additional evidence,

conduct internal or third-party investigations,

rely on carrier or payment provider findings.

Decisions are based on available evidence and applicable policies.

9. Resolution Outcomes

Possible dispute resolution outcomes include:

claim approval and remedy (refund, replacement, or repair),

partial resolution (e.g. partial refund),

claim rejection with explanation.

The Store’s decision does not affect statutory consumer rights where applicable.

10. Legal Proceedings

If a dispute cannot be resolved through support channels, legal proceedings may be initiated in accordance with the governing law and jurisdiction specified in the Terms and Conditions.

The Store reserves the right to defend claims using available documentation and policy records.

11. Relationship to Other Policies

This policy operates in conjunction with:

Returns, Exchanges & Restocking Fees Policy,

Warranty & Repairs (RMA) Policy,

Shipping, Customs & Restricted Items Policy.

In the event of a conflict, the Store Policy Overview determines precedence.
