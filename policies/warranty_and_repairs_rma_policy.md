Warranty & Repairs (RMA) Policy
1. Purpose and Scope

This policy defines the warranty coverage, exclusions, and procedures for repairs, replacements, and returns related to defective products. It applies to all electronic products sold by the Store and should be read together with the Store Policy Overview.

Warranty rights may vary depending on product category, region, and applicable consumer protection laws.

2. Warranty Coverage

Unless otherwise stated on the product page, the Store provides a limited warranty of 12 months from the date of delivery.

Warranty coverage applies only to:

manufacturing defects,

hardware malfunctions occurring under normal use,

defects not caused by external factors or misuse.

Warranty coverage is limited to the original purchaser and is non-transferable.

3. Exclusions from Warranty

The warranty does not cover:

damage caused by misuse, abuse, or negligence,

damage caused by unauthorized repairs or modifications,

cosmetic damage that does not affect functionality,

normal wear and tear,

damage caused by power surges, liquid exposure, or environmental factors,

products with altered or removed serial numbers.

Products falling under these exclusions may be repaired at the Customer’s expense or returned unrepaired.

4. Dead on Arrival (DOA) Policy

A product is considered Dead on Arrival (DOA) if it is non-functional upon first delivery and initial use.

DOA conditions:

the issue must be reported within 48 hours of delivery,

the product must show no signs of misuse or damage after delivery,

photographic or video evidence may be required.

Approved DOA cases are eligible for:

replacement, or

refund, at the Store’s discretion.

5. RMA (Return Merchandise Authorization) Process

All warranty claims require an approved RMA.

The RMA process includes:

submission of a support request with order details,

description of the defect and troubleshooting steps taken,

submission of requested evidence (photos, videos, serial number),

RMA approval or rejection by the Store.

Products returned without an approved RMA may be refused.

6. Repair vs Replacement

For approved warranty claims, the Store will determine the appropriate remedy based on:

nature of the defect,

product availability,

repair feasibility,

time since purchase.

Possible outcomes include:

repair of the original product,

replacement with the same or equivalent product,

refund, if repair or replacement is not feasible.

The choice of remedy is at the Store’s discretion, unless otherwise required by law.

7. Warranty Shipping Costs

For approved warranty or DOA claims:

the Store may cover return shipping costs, depending on region and carrier,

replacement shipping costs may be covered or partially covered.

For rejected claims:

the Customer is responsible for all shipping costs,

products may be returned unrepaired at the Customer’s expense.

8. Warranty Claim Timeframes

Customers must initiate warranty claims:

within the applicable warranty period,

within a reasonable timeframe after discovering the defect.

Delayed reporting may affect eligibility for certain remedies.

9. Refurbished and Replacement Products

Replacement products provided under warranty may be:

new, or

refurbished and functionally equivalent.

Refurbished products meet the same performance standards as new products and may carry the remainder of the original warranty period.

10. Relationship to Returns and Shipping Policies

This warranty policy operates independently of the return rights defined in the Returns, Exchanges & Restocking Fees Policy.

Shipping damage claims are subject to the reporting deadlines and conditions outlined in the Shipping, Customs & Restricted Items Policy.

11. Policy Conflicts and Legal Rights

In the event of a conflict between this policy and applicable consumer protection laws, mandatory legal rights shall prevail.

Where conflicts arise between store policies, the Store Policy Overview determines precedence.
